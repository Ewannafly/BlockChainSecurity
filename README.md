This Project aims to detect the clone smart contracs from both bytecode and source code.
1. Use Adress to grab valid verified ethereum contracts adresses.
2. Use Bytecode and sourcecode to achieve corresponding files from adresses.
3. Use Byecode_detect and Source_code_detect to detect clones respectively.
